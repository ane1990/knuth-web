## About This Server

The server is named "Knuth" as a nod to the influential computer scientist Donald Knuth. See the <a href="/knuth.html" style="color: #ffd700; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #ffd700;">Knuth page</a>.

The goal of this server is to experiment with Linux automation, glue features, and to learn by building and sharing small achievements—some of which are highlighted below. Expect ongoing experiments and short posts in the Achievements section as the project evolves.

## Achievements

- **Created the server**: It is based on a cloud instance on Hetzner, using Ubuntu 24.04 and NGINX installed, at the moment to serve static webpage.
- **Configured the server**: Some stuff done to access the server from remote, ongoing a setup to deploy static webpages with github actions
- **Automated Deployment**: Implemented GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment from <a href="https://github.com/ane1990/knuth-web" style="color: #ffd700;">knuth-web repository</a>. Every push to main branch triggers automatic deployment via SCP.
- **2025-08-02 — Configured a VPN on knuth server**: Installed openVPN server package, generated certificate and keys using easy-rsa, configured the VPN network and ip routing. generated certificate and private keys for the clients to connect. forwarding to the server the DNS gateway and pushing the server vpn IP Address.
- **2025-08-05 — Sudoku on the beach**: Second day during Sardinian vacation, on the beach I tried to solve a Sudoku, then I created a 'static' solver, given in input the starting state of the sudoku I was trying to solve. Demo <a href="/sudoku_solver.html" style="color: #ffd700;">available here</a>.
- **2025-08-18 - Back from holidays**: back home we are thinking to better structure this website, the direction would be a simple blog, always talking about web, programming, Algorithms and AI, check this <a href="/01-blog-a-new-starting-after-holidays.html" style="color: #ffd700; text-decoration: none; border-bottom: 1px solid #ffd700;">page</a>.
