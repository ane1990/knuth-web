## About This Platform

Welcome to Knuth Server, a modern development platform that embodies the principles of elegant engineering and systematic thinking pioneered by <a href="/knuth.html">Donald Knuth</a>.

This platform serves as a showcase for cutting-edge automation, innovative programming solutions, and professional web development practices. Built on robust cloud infrastructure, it demonstrates the power of modern DevOps methodologies while maintaining the clarity and precision that Knuth championed in computer science.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science and practical system engineering, creating solutions that are both technically excellent and beautifully crafted.

## Technical Achievements

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deployed on Hetzner Cloud with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, featuring high-performance NGINX web server optimized for modern web applications and static content delivery.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented sophisticated GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment from the <a href="https://github.com/ane1990/knuth-web">knuth-web repository</a>. Features zero-downtime deployment with automatic rollback capabilities.

- **Security Architecture**: Configured enterprise-grade OpenVPN server with PKI infrastructure using Easy-RSA. Implemented secure certificate management, network routing, and DNS forwarding for seamless remote access.

- **Algorithm Engineering**: Developed an intelligent <a href="/sudoku_solver.html">Sudoku solver</a> using constraint satisfaction techniques and backtracking algorithms, demonstrating practical application of computer science theory.

- **Content Management**: Architected a modern static site generator with markdown processing, template engine, and automated sitemap generation for optimal SEO performance.

- **Network Security**: Deployed <a href="/02-blog-a-fail2ban-quick-guide.html">Fail2ban intrusion prevention system</a> with custom rules and monitoring for comprehensive server protection.
