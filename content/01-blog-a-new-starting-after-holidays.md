## Today, 2025-08-18

Back home from two weeks holidays, also back to work but with some new ideas, goals and good intentions.
This is the first quick post. The website project was refactored in order to have a very simple blog publishing system.

The idea is to keep the blog very simple, without the use of any framework at the moment. I will add core functionalities only if really needed, an keeping the rules `keep it simple!`.
