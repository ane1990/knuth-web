# Knuth Website

This repository contains the website files for the Knuth project.

## Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated deployment. When you push commits to the `main` branch, the website will be automatically deployed to the server.

### Prerequisites

Before the automated deployment can work, you need to set up the following:

1. **SSH Key Setup**:
   - Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f mykey-knuth
     ```
   - Add the **public key** (`mykey-knuth.pub`) to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
   - Add the **private key** (`mykey-knuth`) to GitHub Secrets

2. **GitHub Secrets Configuration**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
   - Add a new repository secret:
     - **Name**: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
     - **Value**: The entire content of your private key file (`mykey-knuth`)

### Manual Deployment

If you need to deploy manually, you can use the following command:

```bash
scp -i mykey-knuth -P 22 -r ./* alberto@knuth-it.duckdns.org:/var/www/html/content/
```

### Server Configuration

The deployment target is:
- **Server**: `knuth-it.duckdns.org`
- **User**: `alberto`
- **Port**: `22`
- **Destination**: `/var/www/html/content/`

### File Structure

The repository contains:
- `index.html` - Main website page
- `knuth.html` - Additional content page
- `css/styles.css` - Shared CSS styles
- `js/scripts.js` - Shared JavaScript functionality
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules for web projects

### Development

To work on this project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Test locally by opening the HTML files in a browser
4. Commit and push to the `main` branch
5. The GitHub Action will automatically deploy your changes

### Code Organization

The project follows a modular structure for better maintainability:
- **CSS**: All styles are centralized in `css/styles.css`
- **JavaScript**: All interactive functionality is in `js/scripts.js`
- **HTML**: Pages reference external CSS and JS files
- **Benefits**: Easier maintenance, better caching, and cleaner code structure

### Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for error messages
2. Verify that the SSH key is correctly added to GitHub Secrets
3. Ensure the public key is properly installed on the server
4. Confirm the server is accessible and the destination directory exists

### Security Notes

- Never commit private keys to the repository
- The `.gitignore` file excludes sensitive files
- SSH keys are stored securely in GitHub Secrets
- The deployment workflow cleans up SSH keys after use
